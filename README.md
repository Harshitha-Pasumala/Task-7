# Task-7
# ðŸ§  Support Vector Machines (SVM) Classification

This project demonstrates the use of Support Vector Machines for binary classification using both **linear** and **non-linear (RBF)** kernels on the **Breast Cancer** dataset.

## Key Features

- Data normalization using `StandardScaler`
- Training SVM classifiers with `linear` and `rbf` kernels
- PCA-based 2D visualization of decision boundaries
- Hyperparameter tuning using `GridSearchCV`
- Model evaluation with accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report
- 5-fold cross-validation for performance assessment

## Libraries Used

- `scikit-learn`
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`

## Concepts Covered

- Margin maximization
- Kernel trick
- Linear vs Non-linear classification
- Hyperparameter tuning (C, gamma)
- Cross-validation
